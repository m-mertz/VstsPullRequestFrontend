# VstsPullRequestFrontend
Mobile-friendly pull request frontend for Visual Studio Team Services.
Still an early prototype. Should eventually allow browsing your active pull requests in VSTS, checking build and merge status and reviewer sign-off, and completing a pull request if all requirements are met.
